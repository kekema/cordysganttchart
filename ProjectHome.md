In Cordys projects, requirements might come up like showing the execution path of a process or case by Gantt Chart, depicting phases, tasks, milestones and events against a calendar timescale.

This project implements a high level Java API to compose a Gantt Chart - the output supported is a Fusion gantt chart. It has an example XForm to render the server-side generated XML.

See the documentation in svn/trunk/doc ([Charting manual](http://cordysganttchart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Charting%20manual.docx)).
